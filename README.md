- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript extends JavaScript by adding types.
- [Got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) - HTTP request library for Node.js

## Future Improvement
- Implement rate limiter, caching in the proxy server.
- Improve page responsiveness so that it looks for more elegant in different resolution.
- Implement server side rendering.
- Improve error handling.
